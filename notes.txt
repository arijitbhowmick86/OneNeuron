GIT Steps

1. Create a new repo in git hub website
2. Create a blank folder in local
3. Open vs from that folder
4. From github, copy the path from the Code option and use the command
    git clone <copied path>
    This creates a clone in the workspace
5. mkdir <diretory name> to create a directory
6. touch <filename.extension> to create any new file. This text file was created using the below command
    touch notes.txt
7.  One time activity to connect git with the correct user profile
    git config --global user.email "arijitbhowmick86@gmail.com"
    git config --global user.name "arijitbhowmick86"
7. git add .  -- Adds all the changes, . means all, to the staging area
8. git commit -m "First Commit"  -- Commits changes from staging to repo
9. git push origin main  --Pushing code to main branch after commit
10. git checkout <a014346ca809af815df324f980ae03e0704f66c1>  -- Workspace moved to revision id.Id copied from a revision of commits in github


Python new environment per project to manage python version : 

conda env list

conda create -n OneNeuron python=3.7 -y

conda env remove -n OneNeuron

source C:/Users/Arijit/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh  -- This is required if the path is not set properly to activate new env

conda activate OneNeuron

pip install -r  libraryRequired.txt  -- Mentioned all the required packages in the file libraryRequired.txt instead of doing it one be one. Needs to be done in every new env

history -- Gives all the executed commands in the current session in VS Code terminal
